## Professional Experience

During the summer, I completed my practicum with ICAP, where I developed a research question from a parent project that implemented an enhanced model of integrating family planning and into existing HIV treatment services at six health facilities in Lusaka, Zambia. I developed an analysis plan that focused on understanding the low number of longer-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) among women compared to shorter-acting reversible contraceptives (SARCs). I have developed this project into my thesis and will also be presenting at Masters Student Day 2022.

## Career Goals

I want to pursue a career that combines data science and the hard sciences. Whether it is working in the pharmaceutical industry or the public health tech industry, I plan to use the skills I gather from this course and my degree to improve the delivery of healthcare to all.
