# Welcome!

My name is Esther Kim and you are viewing my page! 

To quickly introduce myself, I am an MPH student in the Epidemiology department and I am completing an advanced certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. 

I am currently taking Data Science I and created this beautiful website to show off my website building skills. To learn more about me, click [here](about.html).

###  Dashboard

To learn more about inspections performed on popular NYC chain restaurants, click [here](nycinspec.html) or the chart icon on the top right corner. The **NYC Restaurant Inspection Dashboard** focuses on the following 10 popular chain restaurants in NYC:

1. Burger King
2. Dunkin' Donuts (renamed Dunkin')
3. Fresh & Co
4. McDonald's
5. Panera Bread
6. Paris Baguette
7. Pret a Manger
8. Starbucks
9. Subway
10. Sweetgreen

The dashboard contains graphs that show how many of each restaurant were inspected, the scores each restaurant received after inspection, and the critical level of violation (critical vs. not critical). To filter the large dataset and produce a reasonable product, `N/A` observations were dropped for variables `score` and `grade`. `Score` is the number each restaurant received after inspection. `Grade` is the letter grade given depending on the numeric `score` value received. The score to grade conversion is the following: A = 0 - 13, B = 14 - 27, C = 28+. An important note about the critical violations are those that have a `critical` violation are most likely to contribute to foodborne illness.
