# Welcome!

My name is Esther Kim and you are viewing my page! 

To quickly introduce myself, I am an MPH student in the Epidemiology department and I am completing an advanced certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. 

I am currently taking Data Science I and created this beautiful website to show off my website building skills. To learn more about me, click [here](about.html).
